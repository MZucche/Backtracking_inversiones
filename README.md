# Backtracking Investments

Academic Java project implementing a **backtracking algorithm** to explore and evaluate all possible investment combinations under defined constraints (such as available capital or maximum number of assets).

## 🎯 Goal

Find the optimal combination of investments that maximizes profit based on the parameters defined in the program.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Java
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Recursion / Backtracking

## 📂 Project Structure

- `src/` – Java source code  
- `bin/` – Compiled classes (auto-generated by the IDE)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MZucche/Backtracking_inversiones.git
cd Backtracking_inversiones
```

2. Open the project with your preferred IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, NetBeans)

3. Run the class containing the `main` method from the IDE  
   or run from terminal:

```bash
javac -d bin src/*.java
java -cp bin Main
```

## 📚 Project Type

Academic project focused on practicing **algorithm design**, recursion, and solving combinatorial optimization problems.
